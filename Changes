Revision history for Net-Disqus

0.1.3   22/04/2011
        +   Added Net::Disqus::UserAgent, it will select between LWP::UserAgent (the default) 
            and Mojo::UserAgent if it's installed. This behaviour has been added in order to
            make plugging Net::Disqus into Mojolicious easier.

            Disqus API errors.

            Disqus API itself
        +   Check added to see if Disqus is doing maintenance.
